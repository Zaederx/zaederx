A developer in development :) I like learning about and trying out various applications of programming, to feed my own curiosity.

From a professional standpoint though, my main focus of learning and study is the Web Development, with my main tools of choice being Java and Spring-Boot, with Thymeleaf for server-side + the regular Javascript (and more recently typescript), jQuery , HTML and CSS for client-side technologies.

My latest endevours have been exploring new frameworks and technologies, among them being Sass, Typescript, Node and Electron.
