A developer in development :) I like learning about and trying out various applications of programming, to feed my own curiosity.

From a professional standpoint though, my main focus of learning and study is the Web Development, with my main tools of choice being Java and Spring-Boot, with Thymeleaf for server-side + Javascript (and more recently typescript), jQuery, HTML and CSS for client-side technologies.

My latest endevours have been exploring new frameworks and technologies, among them being Sass, Typescript, Vue.js, Node and Electron.
